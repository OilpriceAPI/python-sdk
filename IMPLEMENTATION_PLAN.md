## üîÑ Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **API changes during development**
   - Mitigation: Version lock API, coordinate with backend team

2. **Performance issues with large datasets**
   - Mitigation: Early pagination implementation, streaming support

3. **Dependency conflicts**
   - Mitigation: Minimal dependencies, optional extras

### Timeline Risks
1. **Scope creep**
   - Mitigation: Strict MVP focus, defer nice-to-haves

2. **Testing takes longer**
   - Mitigation: TDD approach, continuous testing

## üìù Notes

- Start with Python 3.8+ support (can add 3.7 later if needed)
- Focus on developer experience over features
- Documentation is as important as code
- Get user feedback early and often
