## 💡 Key Insights from Analysis

### What We Learned:
1. **Current performance:** 7 downloads/day is decent for niche B2B API
2. **Peak was Oct 2:** 164 downloads (likely marketing push - what was it?)
3. **Declining trend:** Need marketing to reverse downward trajectory
4. **Zero community:** No GitHub stars/forks = need visibility
5. **Good foundation:** Solid README, docs exist, production-ready

### What Will Work:
1. **Content marketing:** Blog posts, videos, tutorials
2. **Community engagement:** Reddit, Awesome lists, Python Weekly
3. **Social proof:** Badges, examples, testimonials
4. **Free tier:** 1,000 req/month is generous, emphasize this

### What to Avoid:
1. **Spam:** Don't over-post to Reddit
2. **Salesy tone:** Lead with value, not pricing
3. **Neglecting comments:** Engagement is critical
4. **Ignoring feedback:** Feature requests = future growth
