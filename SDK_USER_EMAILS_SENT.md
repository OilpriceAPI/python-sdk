Hi Bracco,

I noticed you've been using the OilPriceAPI Python SDK - thanks for trying it out!

I'm Karl, the founder of OilPriceAPI. I'm working on making the Python SDK better and would love to understand how you're using it.

Quick questions (no pressure):
- What are you building with the SDK?
- Which features are most useful to you?
- What's missing that would make it more valuable?

Just reply with your thoughts - even a quick one-liner helps!

Also, if you have any questions about the API or SDK, I'm here to help.

Best,
Karl
Founder, OilPriceAPI

Hi [Name],

Just following up on my email below - totally understand if you're busy!

I'm gathering feedback from early SDK users to prioritize what to build next. Even a quick 1-sentence reply about what you're using it for would be super helpful.

Thanks!
Karl
