## How to Add Topics

1. Go to https://github.com/OilpriceAPI/python-sdk
2. Click the **⚙️ gear icon** next to "About" on the right sidebar
3. In the "Topics" field, add the following topics (comma-separated)
4. Click "Save changes"

```

## Why These Topics Matter

### SEO Benefits
- **GitHub Search**: Users searching for "oil prices python" will find your SDK
- **Topic Pages**: Your repo appears on topic pages like github.com/topics/oil-prices
- **Recommendations**: GitHub suggests your repo to users interested in related topics

### Discovery Channels
- Developers building trading algorithms → `algorithmic-trading`, `trading-api`
- Financial analysts → `financial-data`, `market-data`
- Energy industry professionals → `energy-api`, `oil-prices`
- Data scientists → `time-series`, `data-analysis`

### Competitive Advantage
Most competing APIs don't optimize their GitHub topics. By adding comprehensive, relevant tags, you'll appear in more search results.

## Verification

After adding topics:

1. Visit https://github.com/topics/oil-prices and verify your repo appears
2. Search "oil prices python sdk" on GitHub and check ranking
3. Monitor traffic from GitHub in your analytics

## Additional SEO Optimizations

### Repository Description
Update your repository description to include keywords:

**Current:** "Official Python SDK for OilPriceAPI"

**Optimized:** "Official Python SDK for OilPriceAPI - Real-time oil prices, Brent Crude, WTI, Natural Gas, and commodity data for trading and analysis"

### Repository Website
Ensure the website field is set to: `https://oilpriceapi.com`

### Social Preview Image
Add a social preview image in Settings → Options → Social Preview:
- Create a 1280x640px image
- Include "OilPriceAPI Python SDK" branding
- Show code sample or dashboard screenshot
- Improves click-through rate when shared

## Monitoring Impact

Track the impact of these topics:

### GitHub Insights
- Go to Insights → Traffic
- Monitor "Referring sites" - look for github.com referrals
- Check "Popular content" to see which files get most views

### Expected Results
- **Week 1-2**: Increased GitHub stars and clones
- **Month 1**: 20-30% increase in repository traffic
- **Month 3**: 50-100% increase in SDK installations from GitHub

## Next Steps
